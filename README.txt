# Welcome to the code site for my thesis, "Spatial models of linguistic data in Africa and beyond"

The code for the chapters is organised in separate folders. Please bear with me as I clean up and (re)test the code. If you are in urgent need of a specific piece of code, please feel free to write to me and I'll be happy to share it.
